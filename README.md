# NASA-BlackHole

My attempt at recreating the black hole image from the NASA press release.

<img src='./assets/test.jpg'></img>

## Usage

Run `index.html` using a local server.

## Configuration

This project is more of a novelty than anything else. Therefore I did not add any easily configurable options. If you want to change the image, you will have to edit the code.
